#  **Smart To-Do List**

A clean, interactive productivity app built with React to manage daily tasks efficiently.

#  **Overview**

The Smart To-Do List is a modern React web application that allows users to create, edit, complete, and delete tasks while persisting data in the browser using localStorage.
This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy full-featured front-end applications using React hooks, component-based architecture, and state management.

#  **Features**

- Add new tasks with titles and descriptions
- Edit existing tasks directly in the interface
- Delete tasks instantly
- Mark tasks as complete and view them in a separate section
- Data automatically saved using localStorage
- Responsive layout and clean, minimalist UI
- Real-time state updates using React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

#  **Technologies Used**

React.js – front-end framework

JavaScript (ES6+) – core programming language

HTML5 / CSS3 – structure and styling

React Icons – visual elements

LocalStorage API – persistent data management

#  **How It Works**

Add a Task – Type in a title and description, then click “Add.”

Edit Tasks – Click the ✏️ icon to modify the task inline.

Complete Tasks – Mark tasks as done with the ✔️ icon.

Delete Tasks – Remove unwanted tasks permanently.

Persistent Storage – Refreshing or closing the tab won’t erase your data.

#  **What I Learned**

Through this project, I strengthened my:

Understanding of React state management and hooks lifecycle

Ability to handle user interactions and dynamic UI rendering

Experience with data persistence using browser APIs

Skills in writing clean, modular, and maintainable front-end code
